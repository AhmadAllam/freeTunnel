this tool change the last 3 numbers in ip
if you choose it please write ip only like

* scan
* bughosts saved in host.txt and this tool will scan it automatically | now I found the name server (cloudflare) In my case>> then it's working with hatunnel plus or other VPN app

* payload
* if you need to make payload from bughost
and testing it in vpn app
just write the bughost and hit enter

like 
www.google.com >> 142.251.37.36
